Rot is a simple utility that does rotation based ciphers i.e., rot13,
rot47, and is flexible enough to handle arbitrary rules based on ranges of
characters (8-bit).

== Building ==

Rot was originally build with an explicit Makefile, but I experimentally
switched to premake4 to see what it was like. If you don't already have it
then you'll need to retrieve premake4.

Once "installed" you should be able to build rot pretty easily:

$ premake4 gmake
$ make

== Usage ==

By default rot reads from stdin. You can use the --argv or --file options
to override this behavior. Rot always writes to stdout (or errors to
stderr). There are shortcut options for rot13 (--13), rot26 (--26) and
rot47 (--47). Custom configurations can be specified with one --num-places
option and "any" number of --range options. Use the --help option for
more complete usage.
